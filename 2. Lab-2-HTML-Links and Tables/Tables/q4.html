		<tr>
			<td colspan=2 height=200px> Video has become one of the most popular multimedia
artefacts used on PCs and the Internet. In a majority
of cases within a video, the sound holds an important
place. From this statement, it appears essential to make
the understanding of a sound video available for people
with auditory problems as well as for people with gaps
in the spoken language. The most natural way lies in the
use of subtitles. However, manual subtitle creation is a
long and boring activity and requires the presence of the
user. Consequently, the study of automatic subtitle generation
appears to be a valid subject of research.
