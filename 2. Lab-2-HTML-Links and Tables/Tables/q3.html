	<h1 align=center> INTRODUCTION TO OPERATING SYSTEM</h1>
	An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers. 
	Some popular Operating Systems include Linux, Windows, OS X, VMS, OS/400, AIX, z/OS, etc.<br>
	<strong>Definition:</strong><br>
	An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware and controls the execution of all kinds of programs.
	<strong>Following are some of important functions of an operating System. </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Memory Management</li>
		<li>Processor Management</li>
		<li>Device Management</li>
		<li>File Management</li>
		<li>Security</li>
		<li>Control over system performance</li>
		<li>Job accounting</li>
		<li>Error detecting aids</li>
		<li>Coordination between other software and users</li>
	</ul>

		<h1 align=center>USER INTERFACES</h1>
		<br>
		A user interface (UI) refers to the part of an operating system, program, or device that allows a <br>
		user to enter and receive information. A text-based user interface (see the image to the left) displays <br>
		text, and its commands are usually typed on a command line using a keyboard. With a graphical user interface <br> 
		(see the right-hand image), the functions are carried out by clicking or moving buttons, icons and menus by means of a pointing device.<br><hr>

	<p id="io">
		<h1 align=center>I/O Operations</h1>
		<br>
		In computing, input/output or I/O (or, informally, io or IO) is the communication between an information processing system, <br>
		such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals <br>
		or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it. The term can also be used as part of an action; <br>
		to "perform I/O" is to perform an input or output operation.<br>
		I/O devices are the pieces of hardware used by a human (or other system) to communicate with a computer. For instance, a keyboard <br>
		or computer mouse is an input device for a computer, while monitors and printers are output devices. Devices for communication between <br>
		computers, such as modems and network cards, typically perform both input and output operations.<br>
